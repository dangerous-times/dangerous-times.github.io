		<center><h1>Info about using CDC WONDER and the download files</h1></center>
	
		<p>CDC WONDER was used to extract the data to produce the graphs and spreadsheets. E.g. saved CDC firearm homicide report <a target="_blank" href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D293F524">https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D293F524</a></p>
			
		<p>The exported CDC data was reformatted using python program in the download list above. The CDC exported file name is specified as a parm. The program creates 2 CSV files for each CDC exported  (per 100K & simple reformat.</p>
